# Venus Volcano Detection using Classical Computer Vision

This project implements a Venus volcano detection system using handcrafted features and classical machine learning, based on the NASA/JPL Magellan radar image dataset.

The system detects potential volcanic structures in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Venus and visualizes them with confidence-colored bounding boxes and a probability heatmap.

No deep learning or pretrained models are used, as constrainted by lecturer.

Burl, M. (1995). Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool experiment [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5SW34.

## Dataset Overview

| File Type | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `.sdt` | Raw radar image data |
| `.spr` | Image metadata header |
| `.lxyr` | Ground-truth volcano annotations |
| `.lxyv` | FOA candidate locations |
| `trn/` | Training split (FOA candidates) |
| `tst/` | Test split (FOA candidates) |

## Methodology

### Training Pipeline
1. Load SAR images (`.sdt/.spr`)
2. Load FOA candidate points (`.lxyv`)
3. Extract fixed-size image chips
4. Apply preprocessing (median filtering + CLAHE)
5. Extract HOG + GLCM features
6. Undersample background candidates
7. Train SVM classifier
8. Evaluate on held-out test images

### Inference Pipeline
1. User uploads `.sdt` and `.spr`
2. FOA candidates are loaded (test set)
3. Chips are classified by the trained model
4. Volcanoes are visualized with:
   - Confidence-colored bounding boxes
   - Probability heatmap

## Evaluation Metrics

- **ROC–AUC** (classification separability)
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Intersection-over-Union (IoU)** between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes

## Experiment Setup

The model is trained and evaluated using:

- **Experiment C / C1**
  - Training images: `img1` – `img42`
  - Testing images: `img79` – `img134`
